# Configuration for Malware Classification using GNN

# Random seed for reproducibility
seed: 42

# Data configuration
data:
  benign_dir: "data/processed/benign"
  malware_dir: "data/processed/malware"
  train_ratio: 0.7
  val_ratio: 0.15
  test_ratio: 0.15

# Model configuration
model:
  type: "gcn"  # Options: gcn, gcn_deep, gat, graphsage
  num_features: 10  # Number of node features
  hidden_channels: 64  # Hidden layer size
  num_classes: 2  # Binary classification
  dropout: 0.5
  pooling: "mean"  # Options: mean, max

# Training configuration
training:
  epochs: 200
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.001
  weight_decay: 0.0005  # L2 regularization
  num_workers: 0  # Number of data loading workers (0 for single-threaded)
  use_class_weights: true  # Use class weights for imbalanced data
  early_stopping_patience: 15  # Stop if no improvement for N epochs

# Output configuration
output_dir: "results"

# Notes:
# - Adjust batch_size based on GPU memory (32 is a safe default)
# - For small datasets, reduce hidden_channels to prevent overfitting
# - Increase dropout (0.6-0.7) if overfitting occurs
# - For imbalanced datasets, keep use_class_weights: true
# - Try different model types: gat for attention, graphsage for large graphs
